## Privacy Policy for Whosbot - Replies Bot Blocker for Twitter

Effective Date: 2024-09-08

Thank you for choosing Whosbot - Replies Bot Blocker for Twitter ("Whosbot", "the Extension"). We value your privacy and
are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect any
data when you use our Chrome extension.

1. Information We Collect
   Whosbot does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) from users. The extension
   operates locally on your device, processing data from Twitter pages solely for the purpose of identifying and
   filtering bot replies.

2. How Whosbot Works
   Whosbot analyzes replies on Twitter based on publicly available information to detect and block potential bot
   activity. This detection is performed entirely within your browser and does not involve any external servers or data
   storage systems.

Data Processed: Whosbot may temporarily access Twitter reply metadata (such as user handles, tweet content, and reply
count) to detect and block bots.
Local Storage: Any settings or preferences you choose within the extension (e.g., custom block lists) are stored locally
in your browser and are not accessible by Whosbot or any third-party services.

3. No Third-Party Sharing
   Whosbot does not share, sell, or rent your data to any third parties. As we do not collect personal data, there is
   nothing to share.

4. Cookies
   Whosbot does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.

5. Security
   We are committed to ensuring that your data is secure. Since no personal data is collected or stored, the risk of
   data breaches is minimized. Any information processed by the extension remains within your browser.

6. Third-Party Links
   Whosbot may interact with the Twitter platform but does not have control over Twitterâ€™s privacy policies. We
   recommend reviewing Twitter's Privacy Policy for more information on how they handle your data.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
   We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected here, with the updated "Effective
   Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your
   privacy.
